# frame_classification

Leverages the lexical information defined in FrameNet 1.7 to create a classifier that predicts semantic frames (assigning semantic roles to sentence lexical units based on frame elements in FrameNet).

## Dependencies:
- Python 3
- Pytorch
- huggingface/transformers

## How to run:

To kick the tires you can run the command:

`{ python main.py }`

It will execute some unit tests, exemplifying the use of the classifier. 

## Important classes and functions
